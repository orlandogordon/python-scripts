# python-scripts

This folder contains a couple of python files demonstrating my knowledge of the language. I'll look to add to these in the future and maintain this README as an overview of each mini-project. I did rely on various online resources to overcome programming roadblocks I encountered, but all code shown was exclusively written by me.

# blackjack.py
This was my first stab at creating a replayable blackjack game strictly using python. I included classes, functions, loops, and fstrings in the making of this game. In the future I'll look to add to this program by including card visuals, assigning suits to each individual card, and by adding a wager system.

# tic_tac_toe.py
This is a replayable game of tic tac toe that you can enjoy with a friend. In the future it would be fun to attempt to create an a computer to compete against and also include a scoreboard so that a series of games can be tracked. I mainly utilized functions loops and fstrings to complete this.

# budget_app
Testing ground for various components of a larger budgeting/personal finance application I'm working on.
